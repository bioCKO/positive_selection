PREDICTED: ankyrin repeat, PH and SEC7 domain containing protein secG-like
#associated with GO term:
	go='GO:0016324' #apical plasma membrane
	


From Uniprot:
Attaches integral membrane proteins to cytoskeletal elements; 
binds to the erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2, to Na-K ATPase, 
to the lymphocyte membrane protein GP85, and to the cytoskeletal 
proteins fodrin, tubulin, vimentin and desmin. Erythrocyte ankyrins 
also link spectrin (beta chain) to the cytoplasmic domain of the 
erythrocytes anion exchange protein; they retain most or all of 
these binding functions.
