#selected_genes/
#These are genes that were hand selected for further analysis.
#They were selected based mostly off of GO enrichment analyses (see git_Repositories/positive_selection/branch_sites_tests/acropora_foreground)
#Special attention was given to GO terms with similarity to enrichment in the Hemond Dataset.
#List of all genes included here saved as excel spreadsheet all_interesting_GO_genes.xlsx (These were output by R script concensus_go.R)
