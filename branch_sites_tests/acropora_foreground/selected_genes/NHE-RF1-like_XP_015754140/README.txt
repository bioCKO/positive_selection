#PREDICTED: Na(+)/H(+) exchange regulatory cofactor NHE-RF1-like
#associated with GO term:
	'GO:0016324' #apical plasma membrane
	

#From UniProt:
Funciton:
Scaffold protein that connects plasma membrane proteins with members of the 
ezrin/moesin/radixin family and thereby helps to link them to the actin 
cytoskeleton and to regulate their surface expression. Necessary for recycling of 
internalized ADRB2. Was first known to play a role in the regulation of the activity 
and subcellular location of SLC9A3. Necessary for cAMP-mediated phosphorylation and 
inhibition of SLC9A3. May enhance Wnt signaling. May participate in HTR4 targeting 
to microvilli (By similarity). Involved in the regulation of phosphate reabsorption 
in the renal proximal tubules. Involved in sperm capacitation. May participate in the 
regulation of the chloride and bicarbonate homeostasis in spermatozoa.

Several of thes sites are within the PDZ_signaling domain of the protein product (see blast domain results).
These domains are found in diverse signalling molecules.
