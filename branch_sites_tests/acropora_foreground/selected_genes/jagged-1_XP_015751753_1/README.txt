Best hit in Acer transcriptome = comp2116_c0_seq1

#From UniprotKB:
	Function:
		Ligand for multiple Notch receptors and involved in the mediation of Notch signaling.
		May be involved in cell-fate decisions during hematopoiesis.
		Seems to be involved in early and late stages of mammalian cardiovascular development.
		Inhibits myoblast differentiation (By similarity). Enhances fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis
	

	Subcellular Location:
		Membrane; Single-pass type I membrane protein

#The set of three substitutions (305-307) is located within a delta serrate ligand domain, the last of 5 such domains at the C-terminal end of peptide.
#These second two of these, 306 and 307 are both fully conserved in the 8 non-Acroporid taxa included in the alignment.
#The delta/Serrate domains refer to transmembrane notch ligands found in Drosophila.
