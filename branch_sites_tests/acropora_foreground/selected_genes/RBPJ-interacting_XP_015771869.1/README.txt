#PREDICTED: RBPJ-interacting and tubulin-associated protein 1-like
#associated with GO term:
	go='GO:0007219' #notch signaling pathway



From Uniprot:
Tubulin-binding protein that acts as a negative regulator 
of Notch signaling pathway. Shuttles between the cytoplasm 
and the nucleus and mediates the nuclear export of RBPJ/RBPSUH, 
thereby preventing the interaction between RBPJ/RBPSUH and NICD 
product of Notch proteins (Notch intracellular domain), leading to 
down-regulate Notch-mediated transcription. May play a role in neurogenesis.
