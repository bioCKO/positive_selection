#From ensemble:
The Caenorhabditis elegans mec-4 gene encodes a subunit of 
a candidate mechano-sensitive ion channel that plays a 
critical role in touch reception [PMID: 8655580]. The product 
is a mechano-sensory protein (degenerin). At least some of 
the proteins in this group form part of a mechano-transducing 
complex for touch sensitivity. Others include the acid-sensing 
ion channels, ASIC1-3 that are homo- or hetero-oligomeric 
neuronal H+-gated channels that mediate pain sensation in 
response to tissue acidosis. Mammalian ENaC (IPR004724) is important 
for the maintenance of Na+ balance and the regulation of 
blood pressure. Three homologous ENaC subunits, a, b and g, 
have been shown to assemble to form the highly Na+-selective channel.
