#PREDICTED: DNA repair protein XRCC4-like
#associated with GO term:


#From Uniprot:
Function:
Involved in DNA non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) required for double-strand break repair and V(D)J recombination. Binds to DNA and to DNA ligase IV (LIG4). The LIG4-XRCC4 complex is responsible for the NHEJ ligation step, and XRCC4 enhances the joining activity of LIG4. Binding of the LIG4-XRCC4 complex to DNA ends is dependent on the assembly of the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex DNA-PK to these DNA ends
