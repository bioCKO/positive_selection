#PREDICTED: multiple PDZ domain protein-like, partial
#associated with GO term:
	go='GO:0016324' #apical plasma membrane


From Uniprot:
Function:
Interacts with HTR2C and provokes its clustering at the cell surface 
(By similarity). Member of the NMDAR signaling complex that may 
play a role in control of AMPAR potentiation and synaptic plasticity 
in excitatory synapses.


Basically all neuro stuff.
