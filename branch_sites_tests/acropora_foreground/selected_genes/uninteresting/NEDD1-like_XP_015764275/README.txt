#Uniprot:
#Funciton:
Required for mitosis progression. Promotes the nucleation of microtubules from the spindle


#From blast:
#contains a WD40 domain:
WD40 domain, found in a number of eukaryotic proteins that cover a 
wide variety of functions including adaptor/regulatory modules in 
signal transduction, pre-mRNA processing and cytoskeleton assembly; 
typically contains a GH dipeptide 11-24 residues from its N-terminus 
and the WD dipeptide at its C-terminus and is 40 residues long, hence 
the name WD40; between GH and WD lies a conserved core; serves as a 
stable propeller-like platform to which proteins can bind either stably 
or reversibly; forms a propeller-like structure with several blades 
where each blade is composed of a four-stranded anti-parallel b-sheet; 
instances with few detectable copies are hypothesized to form larger 
structures by dimerization; each WD40 sequence repeat forms the first 
three strands of one blade and the last strand in the next blade; the 
last C-terminal WD40 repeat completes the blade structure of the first 
WD40 repeat to create the closed ring propeller-structure; residues on 
the top and bottom surface of the propeller are proposed to coordinate 
interactions with other proteins and/or small ligands; 7 copies of the 
repeat are present in this alignment.
