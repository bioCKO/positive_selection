#associated with GO term:
	go='GO:0016324' #apical plasma membrane


From Uniprot:
Function:
May be involved in actively transporting phosphate into cells via Na+ cotransport. 
It may be the main phosphate transport protein in the intestinal brush border 
membrane. May have a role in the synthesis of surfactant in lungs' alveoli.
