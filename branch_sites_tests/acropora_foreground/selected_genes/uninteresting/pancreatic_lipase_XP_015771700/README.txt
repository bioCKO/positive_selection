#Do not trust this alignment.
#Position 126 called as rapidly evolving even though its the same amino acid.


#XP_015754140.1
#PREDICTED: pancreatic lipase-related protein 2-like
#associated with GO term:
	go='GO:0005615' #extracellular space
	

N species = 12
alignment length = 176 amino acids

#From Uniprot:
Function:
Lipase with broad substrate specificity. Can hydrolyze both phospholipids 
and galactolipids. Acts preferentially on monoglycerides, phospholipids 
and galactolipids. Contributes to milk fat hydrolysis
