From Uniprot:
Calcium-binding protein. May have a role in calcium homeostasis.
Nesfatin-1: Anorexigenic peptide, seems to play an important role 
in hypothalamic pathways regulating food intake and energy homeostasis, 
acting in a leptin-independent manner. May also exert hypertensive roles 
and modulate blood pressure through directly acting on peripheral arterial 
resistance (By similarity)
